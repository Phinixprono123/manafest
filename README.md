# manafest
manafest is an awesome fast visually appealing package manager. It is made to fix the confusion using multiple tools and downloading packages from multiple servers. It is in its earliest release. I plan on adding support for almost every OS possible and make the hassle of downloading things easy so you can focus on work.

## important
**manafest has ony been tested on archlinux. So there can be some issues on operating systems. If you do encounter some errors or bug, please report them here**
